# Axis Comparison GUI

Axis Comparison is a tool that quantifies the error between a detected secondary structure axis and true axis itself. This GUI allows users the control the arguments sent to the executable and then displays the results of the executable in an imaging software. The user can then use the GUI to interact with the results.
